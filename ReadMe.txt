above is the link to the game.
I forgot to add a description to the game so here is controls:
W,A,S,D for the moving up, left, down, and right. Mouse scroll to rotate the character. 

latest changes:
added a character and a level!
added controls so the player can move


in the future the player will be able to shoot and aim with the mouse.
